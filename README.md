WP-Minimal
==========

This is a basic WordPress theme containing only the minimum to start coding.
The purpose of this theme is to provide a starting point, avoiding code that may not be needed in every website. Therefore, it misses a lot of common features  in other base themes.

HTML is based on [HTML5 Bones](http://html5bones.com/) and [HTML5 BOILERPLATE](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

Borrowed a lot of ideas from [Roots](http://www.rootstheme.com/), [Handcrafted WP](http://randyjensenonline.com/thoughts/handcrafted-wp-starter-theme/), and other base themes.

## Features
* HTML5 elements
* Normalize.css
* HTML5shiv
* Google Analytics code
* Theme wrapper from http://scribu.net/wordpress/theme-wrappers.html
* jQuery from Google CDN
